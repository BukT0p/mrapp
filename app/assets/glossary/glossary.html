<h3>accuracy</h3><p>Exact conformity to truth, or presenting the known facts, and refraining from speculation, or extrapolation. In the case of journalism, some experts prioritize "accuracy" over objectivity. These experts believe accuracy to the known facts and transparency about the limitations of known facts to be more important than the impression of objectivity, to the detriment of the audience.<br />(partly adapted from <a class="external" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accuracy">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accuracy</a>)</p>

	<h3>ambient sound</h3><p>The sounds of a specific room, environment, or other space. Ambient sound is used in audio programming to create depth and bring the audience into the story. It may be added to video or photo essay stories as well, to add additional detail and substance to the visual imagery. (all Brian's text)</p>

	<h3>anonymity (online)</h3><p>Anonymity is often confused with Pseudonymity. On the internet much content is effectively anonymous to the majority of the public, as it is published by individuals using pseudonymous or choosing to be "anonymous." Full anonymity on the Internet, however, is not guaranteed since IP addresses and MAC addresses, in principle, can be tracked, allowing to identify the computer from which a certain post was made, albeit not the actual user. Anonymizing services such as I2P</h3><p>The Anonymous Network or Tor address the issue of IP tracking. (partly adapted from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_anonymity#Anonymity_on_the_Internet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_anonymity#Anonymity_on_the_Internet</a>)</p>

	<h3>attribution</h3><p>An explicit or formal acknowledgment of ownership or authorship. In journalism, reporters must follow proper rules for the attribution of a quote, detail, or source. In some cases background information may be provided "not for attribution" if the source wishes to remain anonymous. (partly adapted from: <a class="external" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attribution">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attribution</a>)</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">

	<h3>bias</h3><p>An inclination toward something, prejudice, partiality, or predisposition. In journalism, bias appears when a journalist appears to consider one position, opinion, or source over another. Bias does not mean reporting facts without providing unfounded contradictory information, purely for the impression of objectivity.

	<h3>factoid</h3><p>A brief fact, sometimes trivial, but which provides a measurable detail by which to better understand an element of a news story. (all Brian's text)</p>

	<h3>ISO</h3><p>ISO measures the sensitivity of the image sensor. The same principles apply as in film photography – the lower the number the less sensitive your camera is to light and the finer the grain. Higher ISO settings are generally used in darker situations to get faster shutter speeds (for example an indoor sports event when you want to freeze the action in lower light) – however the cost is noisier shots.

	<h3>pseudonym</h3><p>A fictitious name, used by individuals who wish to work or publish anonymously, such as writers, bloggers, activists, and movie stars. Pseudonyms do not provide technical anonymity online, due to potential tracking of IP addresses, cookies, and other identifying information when publishing content online.

	<h3>transparent</h3><p>Open, public; having the property that theories and practices are publicly visible, thereby reducing the chance of corruption. In journalism, it is particularly important to be transparent about conflicts of interest, potential bias, or limitations to available facts regarding a story.

	<h3>verifiable</h3><p>Able to be verified or confirmed. In journalism this often means the specific detail to be verified or confirmed has been checked with at least three sources. This is not always possible, but details and facts are generally considered verifiable, if they are confirmed by three independent sources.
